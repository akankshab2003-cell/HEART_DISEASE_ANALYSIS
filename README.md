Data analytics project using the power bi

# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes heart disease patient data to understand mortality and survival patterns using Power BI.
The dashboard focuses on identifying how age, gender, diabetes, and hypertension impact patient outcomes and presents insights through clear, interactive visualizations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard storytelling using Power BI.
# 📂 Dataset

Source: Heart Disease Patient Dataset

File: Heart_Disease_Dataset.xlsx

Data includes medical and demographic attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Diabetes

Hypertension

Survival status (DEATH_EVENT)

Target variable:

DEATH_EVENT

0 → Alive

1 → Death
# 🛠 Tools Used

Power BI Desktop

Data cleaning & transformation

Data modeling

DAX measures

Interactive dashboard design
# 🔍 Data Preparation (Power BI)

Loaded dataset directly into Power BI

Handled missing and blank values

Created Age Groups for meaningful comparison

Renamed columns for clarity

Built calculated measures using DAX
# 🧮 Key DAX Measures

Survival Rate (%)

Death Rate (%)

Total Alive Patients

Total Deaths

Average Age

These measures ensure normalized and accurate comparisons across patient groups.
# 📊 Dashboard Features

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

# 🔹 Key KPIs

Average Age

Survival Rate (%)

Total Alive Patients

Total Deaths

# 🔹 Visual Analysis

Death Rate by Age Group

Survival Trend by Age Group

Death Distribution by Gender

Death Rate by Diabetes

Death Rate by Hypertension

# 🔹 Interactivity
Gender slicer for dynamic filtering

Cross-filtering across all visuals
# 📈 Key Insights

Death rate increases significantly after age 60

Patients aged 71+ have the highest mortality risk

Male patients show higher death rates than females

Diabetes and hypertension are strongly associated with increased mortality

Survival probability decreases steadily with age
